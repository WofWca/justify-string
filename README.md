### Disclaimer

* I'm a noobie-boobie with Rust
* I wrote it as challenge, I didn't look up any existing C/C++ and stuff implementations

### Alternatives

* <https://crates.io/crates/justify> - based on a quick glance at the source code, it may be a
little slower and require a more memory compared to this one.
